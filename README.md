# The Lula Programming Language

Lula is a minimalistic byte-code interpreted programming language.

My reasons for making Lula are not to create a fully-fledged production ready
programming language, but instead to help me learn more about writing an
interpreter so that one day I might be able to write a fully-fledged production
ready programming language. :^)

### Licence

Lula is licenced under the MIT licence, which can be seen [here](./LICENCE).
